## Context

- Task requirements: $ARGUMENTS

## Your task

Execute the complete Specification-Driven Development workflow with maximum efficiency and thoroughness:

### 1. Setup and Preparation

**Parallel execution instructions**: When performing multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially for maximum efficiency.

- Create `.tmp` directory if it doesn't exist
- Create a new feature branch based on the task
- Set up the project structure with comprehensive planning

### 2. Stage 1: Requirements Analysis

Execute `/step-1-requirements` command to create detailed requirements specification.

**Critical requirements**:

- Be thorough in identifying ALL explicit and implicit requirements
- Create actionable, measurable specifications
- Include comprehensive edge cases and constraints
- Define clear success criteria

**Present requirements to user for approval before proceeding**

### 3. Stage 2: Technical Design

Execute `/step-2-design` command to create technical design based on requirements.

**Design excellence requirements**:

- Create complete, implementable technical specifications
- Include detailed component interfaces and data flows
- Address all non-functional requirements (performance, security, maintainability)
- Consider future extensibility and scalability

**Present design to user for approval before proceeding**

### 4. Stage 3: Implementation Planning

Execute `/step-3-tasks` command to break down design into implementable tasks.

**Task optimization requirements**:

- Break down into commit-sized, actionable tasks (1-4 hours each)
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Include comprehensive testing throughout the process
- Define clear completion criteria for each task

**Present task list to user for approval before proceeding**

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting

Provide a detailed summary including:

- What was created and where it's located
- Key architectural decisions and rationale
- Implementation readiness assessment
- Next steps for development team

## Critical Success Factors

**Tool Usage Optimization**:

- **ALWAYS use parallel tool calls** when performing multiple independent operations
- Leverage thinking capabilities for complex multi-step reasoning
- Use comprehensive context gathering before making decisions

**Quality Assurance**:

- Each stage output must be detailed, actionable, and implementable
- Wait for explicit user confirmation between stages
- Focus on clarity, completeness, and technical excellence
- Proactively identify and address potential risks and edge cases

**Efficiency Optimization**:

- Plan multiple operations upfront and execute them simultaneously
- Minimize sequential dependencies where possible
- Create comprehensive documentation that reduces future clarification needs

think hard and execute with maximum efficiency
